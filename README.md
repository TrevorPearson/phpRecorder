phpRecorder
===========

Simple php script that saves any data into XML

This simple script allows you to save what you need into a database. During coding you can spend a lot of time setting up a database and defining all the fields. You shouldn't be forced into that detailed task first. This program allows you to make the efficient logging database later.


Setup Guide:
Throw this on a server or download WAMP.

Example commands:
-----------
URL: http://localhost/recorder/phpRecorder/recorder.php?_viewOnly=true
Decription: View the database in your browser

URL: http://localhost/recorder/phpRecorder/recorder.php?CustomWords=Hello%20World&Name=Trevor
Description: Add a record with two columns, "CustomWords" and "Name".

Uses:
-------
I use this to log smaller appications. I like to see you uses them and to see what path they go down. Because the custom program is just doing a get request on a page, the program will not crash if the logger gets moved.
